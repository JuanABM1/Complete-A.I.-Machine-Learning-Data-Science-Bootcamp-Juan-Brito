# introduction

"Machine learning" is currently one of the most popular topics of today and this is mainly because many people, regardless of the field in which they work, have heard of this term since what they are trying to achieve is that computers can perform more functions previously done by people.

## What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) is an important subset of artificial intelligence. **The university of Standford, describes ML as the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved through systems that can find patterns in a set of data**.

## Differences between machine learning, deep learning and data science

Deep learning, is just one of the techniques for implementing ML, like an algorithm.

The field of Data science consists in analyzing data and then doing someting with it, but ML and data science related because you need to be able to understand data and work with it.

## Main Types of machine learning

There are 4 main types of machine learning, **Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, transfer learning** and reinforcement learning but we will focus on the first three because these are tyhe most used and usefull.

### 1 - Supervised learning

Supervised learning, is called supervised because you have data and labels. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn what patterns in the data lead to the labels and if the algorithm guesses a wrong label, it tries to correct itself.

### 2 - Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is when you have data but no labels. The data, for example, could be the purchase history of your online video game store customers. Using this data, you may want to group similar customers together so you can offer them specialised deals. You could use a machine learning algorithm to group your customers by purchase history.

### 3 - Transfer learning

Transfer learning is when you take the information an existing machine learning model has learned and adjust it to your own problem because training a machine learning model from scratch can be expensive and time-consuming. The good news is, you donâ€™t always have to. When machine learning algorithms find patterns in one kind of data, these patterns can be used in another type of data.
