# introduction

"Machine learning" is currently one of the most popular topics of today and this is mainly because many people, regardless of the field in which they work, have heard of this term since what they are trying to achieve is that computers can perform more functions previously done by people.

## Differences between machine learning, deep learning and data science

Deep learning, is just one of the techniques for implementing ML, like an algorithm.

The field of Data science consists in analyzing data and then doing someting with it, but ML and data science related because you need to be able to understand data and work with it.
