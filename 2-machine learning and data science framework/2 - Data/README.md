# Data

In this section, the question we are trying to solve here is what kind of data do we have?

---

## Main types of Data

### Structured

Think a table of rows and columns, an Excel spreadsheet of customer transactions, a database of patient records. Columns can be numerical, such as average heart rate, categorical, such as sex, or ordinal, such as chest pain intensity.

### Unstructured data 

Anything not immediately able to be put into row and column format, images, audio files, natural language text.

### Static data 

Existing historical data which is unlikely to change. Your companies customer purchase history is a good example.

### Streaming data 

Data which is constantly updated, older records may be changed, newer records are constantly being added.
