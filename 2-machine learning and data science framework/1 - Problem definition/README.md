# Problem definition

The most important thing at the beginning is to know what kind of problems you have and what kind of data you will need to develop a machine that fits the problem.

## Matching your problem

There diferents clasifications for the possible problems called **classification, regression and recommendation.**

### Classification 

Do you want to predict whether something is one thing or another? Such as whether a customer will churn or not churn? Or whether a patient has heart disease or not? Note, there can be more than two things. Two classes is called binary classification, more than two classes is called multi-class classification. Multi-label is when an item can belong to more than one class.

### Regression 

Do you want to predict a specific number of something? Such as how much a house will sell for? Or how many customers will visit your site next month?

### Recommendation 

Do you want to recommend something to someone? Such as products to buy based on their previous purchases? Or articles to read based on their reading history?
