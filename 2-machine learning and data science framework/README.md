# Introducing our framework

This section, consists in the creation of one machine learning and data science framework which is a template that I'm going to use for the rest of the course. **The framework that I'm going to use comprises 6 steps**.

## 1 - Problem definition

Since the objective is focused on practical solutions, it's important to define what problem we are trying to solve.

## 2 - Data

What data we have? How does it match the problem definition? Is our data structured or unstructured? Static or streaming?

## 3 - Evaluation

What defines our success? Since much of the machine learning is experimental is almost impossible to make the perfect model.

## 4 - Features

What do we already know about the data and how can influence on the results?

## 5 - Modelling

Based on our problem and our data, it's important to knwo what kind of model should we use because a lot of algorithms have already been coded

## 6 - Experimentation

Based on the results, it's important to think what could we improve or try the next time.
